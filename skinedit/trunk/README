-----------

SkinEdit is a powerful skin editor for VTi and TiEmu.
It can read/modify/write VTi-formatted skins and TiEmu-formatted ones.


FEATURES
--------

- creating skins from scratch by loading an image (JPEG, PNG, ...)
- modifying an existing skin
- exporting the skin to various formats (VTi old & new format)
- save it into the native format (TiEmu)

- LCD area
- keys area
- editing skin properties such as : author, description, colors, model, ...

- information displayed in the status bar

For documentation about the skin internals and key mapping, 
see the doc directory.


REQUIREMENTS (Win32)
--------------------

 - a Windows computer: Windows 95/98/Me or Windows NT4/2000/XP
 - the GTK+ 2.6 libraries
    Location: <http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gladewin32/gtk-win32-2.6.10-rc1.exe?download>
    => the installer can download & install it for you


INSTALLATION (Win32)
--------------------

Run the InnoSetup installer...

1) This setup may download & install some extra libraries (GTK+ 2.6). 

The GTK+ package includes the Wimp (Windows IMPersonator) theme engine which gives 
Windows look & feel (includes XP theming). Is also included the GTK theme selector.
You may need to use it on non-NT systems if you get a lot of warnings about a font. 
Simply disable the WiMP theme for another one.

If anyone is getting one of these:
- ** WARNING **: Couldn't load font "MS Sans Serif 8" falling back to "Sans 8"
- ** ERROR **: file shape.c line 75: assertion failed: (glyphs->num_glyphs > 0)
or any other warning or error message regarding fonts/glyphs, the fix is to
open your C:\Program Files\Shared Files\Gtk\2.0\etc\gtk-2.0\gtkrc and to add this:
	style "user-font"
	{
	font_name="Arial"
	}
	widget_class "*" style "user-font"
This forces GTK+ to use a compatible font (Arial) and reportedly fixes both
the aforementioned problems, and probably others too.

2) This setup will install the GNU's 'wget' utility for download of GTK+
(http://xoomer.virgilio.it/hherold/).
